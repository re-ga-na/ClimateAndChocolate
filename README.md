# Climate And Chocolate

Our project is to uncover patterns in chocolate beans around the world. We'll examine relationships between chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.

We found the dataset on Kaggle called, “[Chocolate Bar Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings#flavors_of_cacao.csv),” that contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars. 

The analysis process was broken into two broad phases: Exploration & Cleanup and Analysis.

We used a Jupyter Notebook to explore, clean, and reformat our data before we could begin to answer the research questions.

**Cleanup & Exploration**
* Convert Objects
* Rename Columns
* Remove null values
* Drop NA
* Replace row content to get unique values
* ecc

**Analysis**
* Top Rating Beans
* Bottom Rating Beans
* Create new df with only relevant columns and beans
* Top Country by Rating
* Top Beans by rating

**Plots**
* Average rating per year all beans
* Average rating per type of bean
* Boxplot Rating for Bean origin countries
* Average rating of the Top 5 countries by higher consistent rating by year
* Goods Flow from Company location, mean rating by years
* Boxplot, Rating for Company Location countries
* Counts of ratings vs bean origin GDPs
* Ratings vs bean origin GDPs

**Conclusions**
